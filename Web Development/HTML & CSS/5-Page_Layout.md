# HTML Page Layout
> Based on the [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

## Semantic Elements
```html
<header> <!-- Defines a header for a document or a section -->
<nav> <!-- Defines a set of navigation links -->
<section> <!-- Defines a section in a document -->
<article> <!-- Defines an independent, self-contained content -->
<aside> <!-- Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar) -->
<footer> <!-- Defines a footer for a document or a section -->
<details> <!-- Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand -->
<summary> <!-- Defines a heading for the <details> element -->
```

## Layout Techniques
### CSS Frameworks
Faster layouts can be created using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.

### CSS Float Layout
The ```float``` and ```clear``` property can be used to format sections of the website. This has the disadvantage of not being flexiable when changes need to be made to the website.

### CSS Flexbox Layout
Flexbox allows for malleable changes to page layout for different screensizes and changes in screensize.

### CSS Grid Layout
This defines the sections of the website into a grid based system of rows and coloums to make the page desgin easier.
